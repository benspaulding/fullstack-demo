# Fullstack Project

## Setup

Run the `./setup` command the first time you work on the project:

```sh
./setup
```

While the `./setup` script is safe to run again, there is no need to after it has been
run once.

## Development

After the `./setup` script has been run once daily work can be started with just
recipies:

```sh
just install
just open
```

## TODO

- setup pre-commit
- setup next
- setup storybook
- setup static file handling
- setup frontend profile
- setup backend profile
